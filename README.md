## Description

Within this repo is a handy tool that lets anyone dynamically create a beautiful yet information README for any project. Using node.js in the terminal, the user simply enters a thorough walkthrough of their project from top to bottom, and then a perfectly functional README is generated and ready to be added to their project.

## Deployed Application

This challenge does not include a deployed application. Instead, a screen-recorded video is submitted alongside the github repo link.

## Future Improvements

## Installation

No installation necessary.
